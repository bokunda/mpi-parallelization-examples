Create a cell structure, which contains:
    • type:
        - 0: cancer
        - 1: medecine
        - 2: tissue

    • strength:
        - if the type is cancer, this number represents the strength of the cancer from the interval [0, 100];
        - if the type is a medecine, the number represents the strength of the medecine from the interval [1, 20];
        - who is the tissue type, the number represents the health condition of the tissue from the interval [0, 10000].

The medecine affects the cells around it by reducing the strength of all cancer cells (by medecine cell health) in the environment at each step.
Also, cancer affects all adjacent fields where the tissue is located, by reducing it
tissue health for its strength. If a cell with a medecine around it does not have a single cancer cell, it changes type
into the tissue. If the strength of the cancer decreases to 0, it becomes tissue. Cancer does not affect the cell with the medecine.
An experiment is being performed. In the matrix - shaped field of dimension n × m, cells were arranged (initially
randomly assigned, with the probability that the cell is cancer 2%, the medecine 18%, and the tissue 80%). After B
steps, print the number of cancer cells, as well as information about the strongest cancer if it is left (create a reduction operation).
Make a simulation of this experiment.
